# V4 step log

Read this log and `IMPLEMENTATION_CONTRACT.md` at every step. Append one entry
per requested step with its scope, intended files, actual checks, blockers and
checkpoint state. Commit/push SHAs and verification are reported after the
commit outside that commit; a later entry may reference an earlier SHA.

## Step 1 — branch safeguards and repository audit

Date: 11 October 2026 (Europe/Copenhagen).

Scope: establish V4 only. No research pipeline, acquisition, migrations,
ingestion, empirical modelling or frozen-document regeneration authorized.

Branch: newly created `v4` from fetched main
`c1e919bca9dfbe89de9e67135fb432fdb0f020e6`, without moving local main or V3.
Remote: existing `origin`; URL and V3 merge evidence are in `repository_audit.md`.

Changes: retain original AGENTS.md guidance and append V4 rules; add this log,
the implementation contract, repository audit, checksum-only protected V3
manifest and a reusable safe baseline/checksum utility. Reserve separate V4
database/run/output identities without provisioning them. Require H in exactly
M0/ME/MW/MEW, preserve observed asking-price Y and separate city models.

Validation completed:

- `make compile`: passed.
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/v4_repository_checks.py --baseline-tests`: 94
  discovered, 71 passed, 23 explicitly skipped, zero failures/errors. Live DB
  and V3 integration flags disabled; candidate-export write isolated in a
  temporary directory. Existing V3 tests unchanged.
- Existing read-only input/archive/syntax functions: 204 frozen raw files,
  793 legacy files and active V3 naming/syntax passed.
- Read-only SQL baseline: all 22 applied migration hashes match source files;
  completed V3 run and five V3 schemas verified. No V4 namespace provisioned.
- Capture followed by `--verify ... --database`: all 1,696 protected file
  records and all five ordered SQL analytical fingerprints unchanged after
  baseline tests. No raw/restricted contents or row-level predictions exported.
- Five temporary synthetic guard tests passed: missing/changed files,
  added V3 files and protected symlinks rejected; V4 roots excluded; existing
  baseline capture cannot be overwritten.
- Checker AST parse and `git diff --check`: passed. Intended publication set
  is exactly AGENTS.md, the three V4 Markdown documents, the checksum-only
  manifest and `scripts/v4_repository_checks.py`; review confirms no data or
  credentials in that set.

Checkpoint state before commit: **READY_TO_COMMIT**; no step-specific blocker.
Commit and push verification are subsequent required actions, reported outside
this commit. No V4 empirical completion is claimed. H qualification and the remaining V4
scientific/implementation gates have not been evaluated and remain BLOCKED for
dependent empirical work. This documentation checkpoint does not clear them.

Requested commit: `chore(v4): establish branch safeguards and repository audit`.
Initial push must set upstream and explicitly target `refs/heads/v4` on origin;
remote HEAD equality must be reported after committing. Failure is LOCAL_ONLY.

## Step 2 — housing context standard in all four models

Date: 11 October 2026 (Europe/Copenhagen).

Starting checkpoint: `ddda2192181c112ca02aba2f7123405ea9150cff`, verified on
local/remote V4 with upstream `origin/v4`; fetched remote was unchanged and
the worktree/staging area were clean. Recorded main base remains
`c1e919bca9dfbe89de9e67135fb432fdb0f020e6`. No Git operation or worktree
conflict was present. All work in this step stays on V4.

Scope: amend the active V4 specification/configuration and consistency tests
only. No research pipeline, data acquisition, source qualification, migration,
empirical modelling or frozen V3 document regeneration.

Read the contract/audit/log and actual V3 Markdown specification/dictionary,
configuration, source-registration implementation/local manifest, candidate
freeze, inference/fold rules and both supporting V3 DOCX XML texts/addenda.
No existing V4 proposal, research plan, specification, dictionary, registry or
active V4 DOCX was found. The six new V4 Markdown documents are clearly labelled
newly authored from available evidence/user decision; no unavailable draft
contents, housing sources, values, city roster or supervisor approval invented.
No active eight-model ladder existed in the available V4 baseline to edit;
every newly established active definition uses the four required models.

Changes:

- Version `v4_housing_standard_20261011`: M0=X+H, ME=X+H+E,
  MW=X+H+W, MEW=X+H+E+W; exact inherited X/E/W, H exactly once.
- Revised RQ1–RQ4 for representation differences, accessibility information
  conditional on housing, geographic/random and cross-city differences, and
  network gains across housing contexts. Primary MEW/ME, replacement MW/ME,
  additional ME/M0, MW/M0, MEW/M0; no adding-H estimand/no-H fallback.
- Retain June 2026 target, separate city OLS/XGBoost models, observed log
  nightly asking-price Y, one housing-qualified prediction sample and matched
  folds per city. Separately document a common OLS union-of-core complete-case
  association sample; no-income reuses both samples and retains H.
- Prefer full-year 2025 apartment sale-price/m2; preserve native values and
  frozen within-city external-area `H=(midrank-0.5)/G_ref`, average tie ranks
  and equal area weighting; log native housing price is a scale sensitivity.
- Carry forward actual thresholds, all 30 frozen candidates, seeds, inference
  and mandatory no-income material-change rules. Thresholds are safeguards,
  not power guarantees. No temporal panel, residential-price outcome model,
  gentrification score or causal housing-price/displacement claim.
- Explicitly record that V3 results were already observed; no retrospective
  preregistration or supervisor approval claim. Authoritative Markdown/index
  distinguishes active V4 from preserved V3/history. No supported V4 DOCX
  workflow/file exists; V3 DOCX is superseded for V4 use, and separately held
  earlier V4 drafts are stale/superseded until a supported regeneration.
- New V4 JSON and read-only metadata utility do not alter V3 configuration,
  runners, migrations, raw data, completed outputs or historical drafts.

Validation completed:

- Targeted `test_v4_specification.py`: 11 tests passed, including versioned
  model/block uniqueness, inherited feature equality, sensitivity retention,
  forbidden-ladder/fallback rejection, contrast priorities, candidate/hash
  equality, sample/missingness rules and Markdown/index/link consistency.
- `make compile` and AST/naming checks: passed.
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/v4_repository_checks.py --baseline-tests`: 105
  discovered, 82 passed, 23 explicitly skipped, zero failures/errors, 44.410s.
  Live DB/integration flags disabled; synthetic evaluator persistence/export
  mocked and the candidate-helper export redirected to a temporary directory.
- `--verify docs/v4/protected_v3_manifest.json --database`: all 1,696 protected
  file records, 22 applied migration hashes and five SQL fingerprints unchanged;
  database checks used read-only transactions. A final filesystem comparison
  after the full suite also confirms unchanged protected V3 bytes.
- `git diff --check`, exact intended-path review and safe publication review:
  passed. Intended files are the V4 contract/log, six new V4 Markdown documents,
  `config/v4/research_design.json`, `src/v4/__init__.py`,
  `src/v4/specification.py` and `tests/test_v4_specification.py`. No raw/private
  data, credentials, V3 source edits or binary documents are staged.

Checkpoint state before commit: **READY_TO_COMMIT**, no specification-step
blocker. The subsequent commit/push/remote-SHA check is required and reported
outside this commit; it does not authorize dependent empirical work.

Empirical blockers: no qualified V4 H source/reference geography or authorized
city roster is recorded. Data/coverage/CRS/fold/sample/rank/inference gates
remain unassessed and BLOCKED. Narrower-city or descriptive-only scope requires
an explicit amendment. This specification checkpoint does not clear those gates.

Requested commit: `docs(v4): make housing context standard in all four models`.
Push explicitly with `git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/v4`, then verify remote
V4 SHA equals local HEAD and report it outside this commit. Failure is LOCAL_ONLY.
