# V4 step log

Read this log and `IMPLEMENTATION_CONTRACT.md` at every step. Append one entry
per requested step with its scope, intended files, actual checks, blockers and
checkpoint state. Commit/push SHAs and verification are reported after the
commit outside that commit; a later entry may reference an earlier SHA.

## Step 1 — branch safeguards and repository audit

Date: 11 October 2026 (Europe/Copenhagen).

Scope: establish V4 only. No research pipeline, acquisition, migrations,
ingestion, empirical modelling or frozen-document regeneration authorized.

Branch: newly created `v4` from fetched main
`c1e919bca9dfbe89de9e67135fb432fdb0f020e6`, without moving local main or V3.
Remote: existing `origin`; URL and V3 merge evidence are in `repository_audit.md`.

Changes: retain original AGENTS.md guidance and append V4 rules; add this log,
the implementation contract, repository audit, checksum-only protected V3
manifest and a reusable safe baseline/checksum utility. Reserve separate V4
database/run/output identities without provisioning them. Require H in exactly
M0/ME/MW/MEW, preserve observed asking-price Y and separate city models.

Validation completed:

- `make compile`: passed.
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/v4_repository_checks.py --baseline-tests`: 94
  discovered, 71 passed, 23 explicitly skipped, zero failures/errors. Live DB
  and V3 integration flags disabled; candidate-export write isolated in a
  temporary directory. Existing V3 tests unchanged.
- Existing read-only input/archive/syntax functions: 204 frozen raw files,
  793 legacy files and active V3 naming/syntax passed.
- Read-only SQL baseline: all 22 applied migration hashes match source files;
  completed V3 run and five V3 schemas verified. No V4 namespace provisioned.
- Capture followed by `--verify ... --database`: all 1,696 protected file
  records and all five ordered SQL analytical fingerprints unchanged after
  baseline tests. No raw/restricted contents or row-level predictions exported.
- Five temporary synthetic guard tests passed: missing/changed files,
  added V3 files and protected symlinks rejected; V4 roots excluded; existing
  baseline capture cannot be overwritten.
- Checker AST parse and `git diff --check`: passed. Intended publication set
  is exactly AGENTS.md, the three V4 Markdown documents, the checksum-only
  manifest and `scripts/v4_repository_checks.py`; review confirms no data or
  credentials in that set.

Checkpoint state before commit: **READY_TO_COMMIT**; no step-specific blocker.
Commit and push verification are subsequent required actions, reported outside
this commit. No V4 empirical completion is claimed. H qualification and the remaining V4
scientific/implementation gates have not been evaluated and remain BLOCKED for
dependent empirical work. This documentation checkpoint does not clear them.

Requested commit: `chore(v4): establish branch safeguards and repository audit`.
Initial push must set upstream and explicitly target `refs/heads/v4` on origin;
remote HEAD equality must be reported after committing. Failure is LOCAL_ONLY.
